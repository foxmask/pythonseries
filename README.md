pythonseries
============

The original script from JEDIBC is made in PHP.

This is a python version for his own need and is totaly free to use ;)

this lib use the BetaSeries API. 

Configuration:
--------------
Edit series.config to add your login, password, and key.

```ini
[auth]
login=
password=

[api]
key=
```

Running:
-------
Then, to see what commands are available for the moment,  run :

if you use optparse : 
```python
python go.py -h 
```

if you use argparse:  
```python
python go_new.py -h 
```

I recommend the second one as the help page is clearer ;)

Conclusion:
-----------
HaveFun
